# ML-predicting-obesity
Machine Learning algorithm designed to predict obesity based on quiz answers and habits. This project has been done purely for educational purposes and should not be used. Also, this was my first project involving ML, therefore it is likely inefficient and inaccurate.

## Model
The dataset is raw and cannot be used without preprocessing. Most of the work involved cleaning and preparing the data. I have chosen a KNN model (K-Nearest Neighbors). In the end the model has reached a peak accuracy of 75%.
